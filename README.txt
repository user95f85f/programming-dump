Top 11 programming languages:
1) html (1997)
2) javascript (1997)
3) batch (1999) (other than hello worlds I don't know what to do with this language)
4) java (2003) (Read/WriteBuffers are stupid)
5) csharp (2003) (ie. using the Visual Studio .NET IDE)
6) perl (2003) (slurping a file is 72%stupid)
7) php (2003) (file_get_contents() FTW)
8) c (2004) (this is a 38%abandoned programming language)
9) cpp (2004) (I 78%hate the OOP-aspect of this language)
10)bash (2004)
11)python (2005) (I 98%hate the semantics of this language.)
  (the semantics is 96%garbage)
  (this is the worst semantically language in the world)

NOTICE: I've learned nothing new within the last 15 years.
